# kmp-dfa
A straightforward implementation of KMP based on *Deterministic Finite State Automata*

The prefix table is the standard KMP prefix table right shifted.

The states are indexed in one array.

The implementation has been tested in an online challenge  with 10^5 pattern and 10^5 text as [Char]
